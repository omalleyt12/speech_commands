Ok, at this point my priorities HAVE to be:

1) Incorporating Heng's strategy for unknowns and silence
2) Creating models for MFCC and raw wave features
	- I will have to spin up 3 servers so that I can run these in parallel
	- I will have to adopt argparsing so that I don't have to keep changing things, and can keep GH up-to-date
3) Ensembling these models together
