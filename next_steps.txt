Next Steps:

Dang, Drive Conv only scored a .79 ...but I like that at least it gives high validation AND training scores

1) Add another FC layer at the end of Drive Conv

2) Beef up the sizes of these FC layers a few times

3) Go back to the 1d conv and do more convs in the first place to get to the "MFCCish" features, don't just do 70-stride dropout lol
